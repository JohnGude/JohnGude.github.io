"<h2>Summary</h2>" +
"<p>I was born in 1976 in a town called York, in the county of Yorkshire, located in the Northeast of England. York is a very historic town visited by people from all over the world every year, its main attraction is due to its strong connections with the Vikings among many others. Personally, I like that it was the birthplace of Rowntree’s Chocolate (now Nestle) and I always remember cycling home from work to the smell of chocolate which could be detected all over the city. I am a Karate instructor and have taught many people over the years, but I also have a love for cycling, running and sports in general but generally I love walking my English Springer Spaniel, Elsie, named by combining letter sounds of my children’s names. I speak to a basic level of other languages, with English being my native tongue, but I do have a strong dialect from being raised in Yorkshire. General pastimes now consist of going to the beach, watching my children at sports events, and playing Golf or Snooker. I emigrated to Melbourne, Australia around 2017 with my family and have now become a citizen of Australia.</p>"+
"<p>Interestingly i study programming nearly every evening and weekend and prefer that to watching tv, more recently i have completed the RMIT programming course (Python).</p>"

export let it_interests = 

"<h1>IT Interests</h1>" + 
"<p>Information Technology has changed dramatically over the last 25+ years, when I first started my career, we only had access to very basic technology and much of my interest was around this technology. I followed school subjects which gave me access to the current technology of the time, basic circuit design and logic gates. Later I went to college to continue this study area, again the technology was still limited by today’s standards, but I followed electronics and communications engineering as my subject areas. As time progressed, I moved into other areas, from deep communication protocols to CAD and visual technology and then later into design management and infrastructure design management using digital engineering. I have always been interested in technology, but more so the learning of a new skill or understanding of something is the real driver. There was no real person or event that particularly stands out of why I have an interest in IT from my past but the desire to understand how and why things work and what can be done with technology is of great significance in my career and life more broadly."+
"<p>I chose to come to RMIT because of the desire to learn professional level programming and development in technology within network topology, web dev and design patterns, this is in direct relationship with my current role as I work with some very advanced systems and technology in the market it helps me to understand the business value across $b projects. I chose RMIT, both from my own research and from appointing professionals into roles within my business where I see the quality of their knowledge that I wished to learn. RMIT therefore provided the depth and breadth with the flexibility of on-line learning to fit with my current role.</p>"+
"<p>My expectations for learning are to fill missing links between my career and self-study learning within IT in general. The expectation is that I learn the professional way of applying what I know, specifically in coding and design patterns. I also hope to understand some of the more complex topics which are difficult to learn at home. Additionally, it would be a fantastic achievement to gain a qualification to the level that backs my career-based knowledge, the idea to take it step by step rather than full commitment via the online learning and modules provided allows me to stay in control of when its best for me to learn, this promotes a higher success rate rather than trying to do everything at once.</p>";

"<h1>Ideal career Career Position</h1>" + 
"<p>My ideal role would be Chief Digital Officer and follows on from my current role of Chief Technical Engineer ANZ. This role is the next evolutionary step in my career, having worked within this field for 25+ years my knowledge and understanding across multiple sectors at a global level is consummate to this role. This position provides me with the level of influence to develop global frameworks rather than national or country level frameworks. It allows access to additional resources and skills to enable cohesive ideas and technology solutions to come together to solve complex engineering problems. This solving of complex problems is one of the driving forces of choosing this career path.</p>"+
"<p>The skills and qualifications in this role have more to do with experience and exposure to the type of work involved, soft skills in how I present, articulate arguments and leadership in direction for technology solutions. It is however better to have qualifications which support the experience, and therefore why I am trying to achieve a degree in IT.</P>"+
"<p>In summary the skills and qualifications required may consist of:</P>"+

"<h1>Project Idea</h1>" + 
"<h2>Overview</h2>" +
"<h4>Digital Twin Analytics Application</h4>" +
"<p>A Digital Twin provides a digital representation of the real environment, using layered data both in model, GIS services and IoT input. This project is to provide a multi-platform Digital Twin using open-source frameworks which connects to secure data endpoints which provide safety data. A GUI will provide Digital Twin safety data over time for each asset selected within the twin. The GUI selection points will provide safety analytics to the user in real time and provide comparable historical data to provide safety cases for infrastructure development works. </p>"+
"<h4>Motivation </h4>" +
"<p>The project will provide real time and source data analytics across the Digital Twin evolution, understanding where safety issues are and how design, construction and asset management has reduced or contributed to safety is important. An asset chosen at design stage could demonstrate that the asset chosen is a poor design choice prior to build (being analysed as a systems (transport)), because the worlds safety asset data can construct a safety case around that asset. Why one design is safer than another design? How does that compare to other assets of the same type around the world in terms of its safety rating? These make interesting analytics to then allow Ai to determine design patterns using big data.</p>"+
"<h4>Description </h4>" +
"<p>The digital twin analytics application allows the user to upload a layered Digital Twin loaded from any source and then this is displayed in both a graphical model form and analytically in data form.  A direct feed of any object movements (Trains, Aircraft, Busses and even people) are fed into the model.  The application connects to multiple data API endpoints globally to establish the safety data using governmental safety databases (ie. Rail – DOORS NG – project, business, Alliance, and global access), National safety framework (UK-Network Rail, UK-TFL). The application will also connect into design delivery models, within transport – Global - Railway infrastructure (Bentley - Projectwise) and then convert the file formats to the ifc schema before loading as a layer to the Digital Twin. As the Industry Foundation Class (ifc) schema will contain the metadata as required by government contracts, this can be extracted, and the design model can be analysed against the incoming endpoint data (ie. DOORS NG).  This then allows a scoring mechanism to be achieved against the design model and safety data.  This will then be added to the Digital Twin as current ‘hotspot’ data, from the endpoints, and this will then be overlaid on the digital twin providing a user with graphical risk analysis against current and new assets being added to the design models. The potential opens up to then use AI to establish safety data to predict the risk profile of design, construction and asset management activities based on current and live data feeds as the risk profiles change over time, elimination and avoidance of accidents across a number of sectors can be established using real world feedback. The cost saving in using a particular design or asset due to safety data prediction is not predictable, but we can imagine the cost of an asset being introduced into a network and then later being removed on safety grounds would be significant. An example being the current Victoria Level Crossing Removals Project</p>"+
"<h4>Tools and Technologies </h4>" +
"<p>The hardware needed is simply a device with an internet connection and a browser, as the format is ifc we can use the following: (all opensource apart from Bentley ProjectWise and Mongo)</p>"+
"<ol>"+
"<li>MERN</li>"+
"<li>Node.js or eqv</li>"+
"<li>React framework</li>"+
"<li>git</li>"+
"<li>github</li>"+
"<li>ifc.js</li>"+
"<li>three.js</li>"+
"<li>AWS</li>"+
"<li>Mongo db</li>"+
"<li>itwin.js/Adesk Forge</li>"+
"<li>Bentley Projectwise or ADesk- BIM 360</li>"+
"</ol>"+
"<h4>Skills Required </h4>" +
"<p>The skills required to achieve this project involve multiple expertise in multiple areas, rather than describing individual skills, career families are more appropriate.</p>"+
"<ol>"+
"<li>Systems Engineers: DOORS, Safety Schema SYSML. Etc.</li>"+
"<li>Safety case schema and DOORS integration analytics</li>"+
"<li>Developer – Web, full stack</li>"+
"<li>Provision of production and administration of the application using open-source software suit</li>"+
"<li>BIM Engineer</li>"+
"<li>Provision of production of a model and metadata</li>"+
"<li>Digital Engineers</li>"+
"<li>Provision of model file compatibility and federation</li>"+
"<li>Systems Design engineer (ProjectWise Administration and configuration)</li>"+
"<li>Provision of connecting to multiple model instances for model federation and data collection at design and construction stages</li>"+
"</ol>"+
"<h4>Outcome</h4>" +
"<p>The project has the potential to combine safety data into a live digital twin globally, and this allows AI to be used to look for significant safety issues before they occur or indeed before anyone has built the design. Today this data is fragmented in multiple formats and it’s not possible to see the safety issues early. The cost savings in legal, build, accident rates etc would be significantly reduced but does represent challenges in how data is applied to schemas from global perspective. The live data feeds are another significant step with feedback data being applied to a recursive model. The continuous feedback loop will provide significant cost and accidents to be reduced which is all in the name of saving life.</p>";
